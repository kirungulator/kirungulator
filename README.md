- 👋 Hi, I’m @kirungulator
- 👀 I’m interested in collecting rags for craft materials.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning crafts that rags dont see
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on crafts so that rags can think crafty with crafts, and hopefully feel guilty about selfragging.
- 📫 How to reach me ragging science

Ofcourse rag, ragging, crafts, crafty has been used in place of important and serious words, but not expecting anyone to crack a code. I want to use it for self-reflection from time to time.
